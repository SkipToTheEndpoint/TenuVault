/**
 * The API routes of the paid workflows added for the pricing page roadmap, and the plan
 * feature each action needs. The main process enforces these in planGuard and again in
 * the route itself; the renderer uses the same table for badges.
 *
 * Every request is `POST { tenantId, action, ... }`. The action name decides the feature:
 * - `list...` and `get...` only return records that were already created and stored, so a
 *   tenant keeps read access to its own evidence after a downgrade or license expiry.
 * - An action with one of the route's `prefixes` needs that feature instead of the route's.
 * - `revoke-...` actions are free too: they only turn off or delete local outbound
 *   configuration (a notification webhook), never tenant settings or
 *   evidence, so an admin can always stop data leaving the device after a downgrade.
 * - `portfolio-...` actions also need `portfolio` (MSP) and name every other tenant they
 *   read in `targetTenants: [{ tenantId }]`, so the plan is checked on each of them.
 * - Every other action needs the route's `feature`.
