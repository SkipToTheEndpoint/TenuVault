 * Counting follows comparisonCounts, the same numbers the Frameworks page shows:
 * - matching, different, missing: setting checks the comparison could evaluate.
 * - unknown: checks and requirements marked "unable to check" (collection failed, unreadable
 *   values, no detector). They are not evidence either way.
 * - outside scope: checks for platforms the admin left out of the comparison.
 *
 * score    = matching / (matching + different + missing), over evaluated checks only
 * coverage = evaluated / (evaluated + unknown)
 *
 * With no evaluated check there is no score at all ("not scored"), never 0 % or 100 %.
