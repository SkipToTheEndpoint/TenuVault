/**
 * Documented ranking criteria for the top gaps a score shows (docs/roadmap/137-dashboard-baseline-scores.md). Pure and
 * deterministic: the same gap always gets the same priority and the same reasons.
 *
 * Risk (what the gap exposes):
 * - Conditional Access or tenant-wide gap: +30. Identity controls apply to every sign-in.
 * - A setting is configured to a different value: +25; a setting is missing: +20. A
 *   different value on an assigned policy is an active misconfiguration: +10.
 * Impact (how much of the framework it touches):
 * - A directly evidenced control is affected: +15; only supporting controls: +5.
 * - Each affected control: +4, at most +20.
 * Confidence (never raises the priority):
 * - Mixed policy evidence, unknown checks, unknown assignment or incomplete collection add
 *   no points; they add a reason telling the admin to confirm the evidence first.
 *
 * Levels: 70 and above critical, 50 high, 30 medium, below 30 low.
