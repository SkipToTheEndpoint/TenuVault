 *    clickable for the action: a GatedButton explains the plan instead of failing.
 * 2. A whole paid screen shows a LockedPreview: what it does and what it would show, never a
 *    blurred result, because paid results are not computed for plans that do not include them.
 * 3. Records created on a paid plan stay readable after a downgrade; only new ones are locked.
 *
 * The main process enforces the same limits (plan-gates.ts, features/route.ts); these
