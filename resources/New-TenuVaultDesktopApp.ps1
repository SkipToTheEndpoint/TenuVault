.SYNOPSIS
    Creates the app registration the TenuVault desktop app signs in with.

.DESCRIPTION
    TenuVault Desktop uses an app registration that lives in your own tenant. It is a
    public client (no secret, no certificate) with delegated permissions only, so every
    call runs as the signed-in admin and is subject to your Conditional Access policies.

    The script:
      * creates a single-tenant public client app registration
      * adds the loopback redirect URI (system browser sign-in)
      * requests the delegated permissions TenuVault uses
      * grants tenant-wide admin consent for those permissions
      * optionally limits sign-in to members of one group

    Requires the Microsoft.Graph.Applications and Microsoft.Graph.Identity.SignIns modules
    and a Global Administrator, Privileged Role Administrator or Cloud Application
    Administrator (plus consent rights) account.

.PARAMETER TenantId
    Tenant to create the app registration in. Defaults to the tenant of the account you sign in with.

.PARAMETER DisplayName
    Name of the app registration. Default: "TenuVault Desktop".

.PARAMETER AllowedGroupId
    Object id of a security group. When set, only members of this group can sign in to TenuVault.
    Recommended: use a group of the admins who run TenuVault and make sure you are a member.
    Assigning a group needs Entra ID P1 or P2, and only direct members get access (nested
    groups do not). Off by default so an admin who is not in the group is not locked out.
